# SNORT-An-Open-Source-Project
Cyber threats are evolvingâ€”our defenses need to keep up. In this project, I deployed Snort IDS on Ubuntu &amp; Kali Linux, crafting custom rules to detect and block attacks like SQL Injection, Port Scanning, RCE, and more.
## âš¡ Key Actions:
- ~ Set up a secure network with Ubuntu & Kali Linux on VirtualBox

- ~ Created tailored Snort rules to block various attack vectors

- ~ Tested real-world attacks to validate defenses

## ðŸŒŸ Why it matters: 
Working with Snort IDS provided invaluable hands-on experience, highlighting the importance of proactive defense in modern cybersecurity.
